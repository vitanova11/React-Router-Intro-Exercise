# React-Router-Intro-Exercise

For this assignment, you should use the React Router to build a vending machine!

What does this mean? Your application should consist of the following:

* A VendingMachine component, which shows a page with a list of snacks that you can get from the vending machine.
* At least three different snack components, each one corresponding to a vending machine snack.
* By clicking on an item in the VendingMachine you can view one of things inside of the machine. Clicking should update the URL and show the snack that youâ€™ve clicked on.
* From each snack component, you should be able to go back to the main VendingMachine component.

### Further Study
Add a second copy of the links to a site-wide navigation bar. This should show up at the top of each page. When you are already at that page, have it be bolder/darker in the navigation bar.
